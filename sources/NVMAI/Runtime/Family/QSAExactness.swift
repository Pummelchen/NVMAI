/// QSA scores mean-pooled key blocks with a small indexer head set and keeps
/// the `budget / compressRatio` highest-scoring complete blocks, plus the
/// incomplete tail block always. Below a certain context that selection is
/// vacuous -- every visible block is kept -- and dense attention computes
/// exactly the same thing the sparse path would.
///
/// That window is worth pinning as a type rather than a scattered comparison,
/// because it is the boundary between "correct" and "silently attending to a
/// subset of the context". A query beyond it needs the real indexer; running
/// dense there is not slow, it is wrong in a way nothing downstream reports.
///
/// Derived from the geometry, and independently equal to the 2,051 the
/// upstream model card cites for its mask becoming quadratic: at budget 2048
/// and compress 4 the indexer keeps 512 complete blocks, so a query stays
/// exact while `visibleKeys / 4 <= 512`, i.e. through 2,051 visible keys.
