/// Qwen3.8-Flash-Next's Gated Residual ("hyper-connections").
///
/// The residual is `streams` parallel copies of `dim` (4 x 2560 in
/// production), carried that wide for the whole stack. Every sublayer reads a
/// single `dim`-wide vector out of it through a learned gate and writes its
/// output back into every stream through another:
///
///     normed = groupedRMSNorm(streams, hcNorm)         // per-stream slices
///     mix    = sigmoid(Wup @ silu(Wdown @ normed / S)) // S = stream count
///     input  = mean over streams of mix * normed       // -> dim
///     ... block runs on `input`, producing `blockOut` ...
///     inject = 2 * sigmoid(Winj @ normed / S)          // -> S
///     streams += blockOut (x) inject                   // outer product
///
/// Composition rather than new kernels: the three projections are ordinary
/// INT4 affine GEMVs, and only the two stream-axis steps needed writing. The
/// model-level mixer that collapses the streams before `lm_head` is the same
/// read path with no inject, so `encodeRead` serves both.
///
/// Scratch is owned per instance and sized once; `encodeRead` must complete
/// before `encodeWrite` reuses `normed`, which the caller gets for free by
/// encoding the block between them on the same command buffer.
