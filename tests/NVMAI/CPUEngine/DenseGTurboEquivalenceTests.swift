/// A repack is a byte copy, so a dense `.gturbo` install must be *exactly* the
/// snapshot it came from. This is the gate that says so.
///
/// It is opt-in, and deliberately not part of the default suite: it loads two
/// real 2B-9B models and runs inference, which the unit tests otherwise never
/// do (`AGENTS.md`). Enable it with `NVMAI_DENSE_EQUIV=1` and point
/// `NVMAI_DENSE_EQUIV_PAIRS` at `<snapshot>:<install>,...`; `tools/repack_dense.sh`
/// does both for you.
///
/// The reason this is a permanent test rather than a one-off probe: the failure
/// it catches is *silent*. A wrong width, or a wrong per-tensor width, changes
/// the stride of the dequantize, divides evenly, passes every shape check, and
/// answers fluently and wrongly. Nothing downstream of the loader can see that.
